A calculator project using Python is a simple program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users input numbers and select the operation they want to perform, and the calculator displays the result. The project typically involves creating a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt, handling user input, performing calculations based on that input, and displaying the results back to the user. It's a great beginner project for learning Python programming and GUI development.
